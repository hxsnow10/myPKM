Personal PKM proposal and solution.

please refer to https://www.evernote.com/pub/hxsnow10/pkm for some files.
introduction
------------
Aimming to offer a good proposal for human's Personal Knowledge Management. 

I should give __Definition of PKM__ firstly in the following, then __design and implement my freamwork solution__, and finally __practice in my example__.To be interated(迭代).

Tips:
+ PKM should implemented in many layers and aspects.
+ Contents is important as well as freamwork、tools、language form, because only concrete contents has meanings/s.
+ Freawork(Form) work for contents, they make knowledge representation solved better.
+ Everyone has its own answer for PKM.

Firstly, it should be my own personal answer about PKM framework and PKM praceticing.But I also hope to update this framework when researching ourselves and modern technology, which give PKM prosoal and solutions for all future humans, including considerations about complexities.

Definition of PKM
-----------------
Humans,today,facing more data and more knowledge whereas more powerful computing machine like super computer and knowledge represetation and processing technoloObjectiongies like machine learning.These leads what we call artificial intelligence and super intelligence age, which mean knowledge intelligence objects has rapaidly shift from original humans to computing machines, no matter what's the relationship between humans and machines.And the strture or saying technology of knowledge representation and process , as the insense(本质) of intelligence, whether machematically or physical, will greatly changed.

Engineering updates of modern intelligence technology mainly targets various knowledge system(knowledge base with computing engines).Many systems could be regareded as knowledge system, e.g. internets with search engines, wiki systems, various internet products, original human brain, human 文明 system.PKM is an really important aspects, beceuse it focues on how an intelligence object construes from down to top.In civilizeration's view,we're to rebuild civilizeration language and knowledge system(refer to ).Automate Research field(refer to) and Matrix knowledge system should be parts of it(refer to ).

PKM, Personal Knowledge Management, as objects shift and strture change unstoppable, we're searching better solutions for Personal Knowledge Management.

Objection of PKM
-----------------
Objection/measurment of PKM including two aspects:
1. meanings/values of PKM
It is a difficult and easy question:No one definition.
It's none.It depends.It's created personally.

Just like a question, what is object of a solar system?

1. 现代人循规蹈矩，小学-大学-博士-公司。。。    不一定多有人都能或者愿意选择这样的生活。生活有各种姿态.
2. 人有人的特点，自己觉得好就行。全信息管理与简单的生活一定有优劣之分吗？其实对我们这种生物，在生物基础上要适中，要调度。

refer to [phiolohy of world and us::meaning of life]()

2. perfmance of PKM
which is the really measurment in technology perspective.



version 0.1
---------
I give a PKM solution personally.I will explain why i do so, and how to do it good.in fact, i'm serching for the way.

there is mainly two bases of PKM:
+ body human brain: where 'me' and feeling in centrally.
+ computng technology: great power.

My proposal here:
1) use computing technology to replace overload working even work human can't do
2) change ourselves for we aren't a single human machine, but a intelligence machine designer, manager, user.That is new model we will work in.
3) keep 'us' good.research biology,psychology,neuroscience and technology. 

the kernel work is [intelligence]().


notes
-------------
4-15 我的观点发生了改变。倘若我们追求一种智能，但为何要建立在自身的高负担之上呢？
生物上进化结果是，人只能察觉一部分的计算，虽然保留了对潜意识控制的通道，这种减负是一种对于“我”的自我保护。
那么，如果我要去建立一种超智，现代的科技我觉得已经能在计算上取代人，而不用把人作为一个处理的中心节点。
什么意思呢？就是我们控制计算机/机器人，去计算与掌握知识。这既是智能的更佳方案，也是对生物自我的救赎与解放之路。

我会把工作慢慢转移到机器上，我设计智能，管理智能的发展与迭代，这是更好的PKM。
生物自我上我想活得轻松。
